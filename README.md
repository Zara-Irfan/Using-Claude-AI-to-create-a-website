# Project Name — Website Built with Claude AI
Overview

This project is a simple website created using Claude AI as the main assistant for writing content, generating structure, and guiding the development process. The goal of this project is to show how someone with no coding background can still build a website step-by-step with the help of an AI tool.

The website contains basic pages, text, layout ideas, and instructions that were created using Claude AI’s responses.
